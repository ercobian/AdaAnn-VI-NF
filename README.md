# AdaAnn-VI-NF

The code for the numerical examples in "AdaAnn: Adaptive Annealing Scheduler for Probability Approximation" by Emma R. Cobian, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Fang Liu, and Daniele E. Schiavazzi. This paper can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00792">here</a>. (arXiv:2202.00792)

## 1D Planar Flow Examples
The 1D planar flow jupyter notebook contains the code needed to run the Motivating Example, Example 1: 1D Bimodal Distribution, and Example 2: 1D Mixture Gaussian Distribution. This notebook contains the implementation for running these examples using our AdaAnn scheduler, a linear scheduler, and no scheduler.

## 2D Planar Flow Example
The 2D planar flow jupyter notebook contains the code needed to run Example 3: 2D Bimodal Distribution using our AdaAnn scheduler, a linear scheduler, and no scheduler.

## 3D Lorenz Example
The 3D lorenz jupyter notebook contains the code needed to run Example 4: Lorenz Attractor using our AdaAnn scheduler.

## 3D HIV Example
The 3D HIV jupyter notebook contains the code needed to run Example 5: ODE system for HIV dynamics using our AdaAnn scheduler and no scheduler.
